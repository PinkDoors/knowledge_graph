You are given a subject description. Your task is to generate a single linear step-by-step learning path for this subject.
Subject description is delimited by ``` and provided to you.

Rules:
The learning path MUST be strictly linear.
If two concepts are learnt simultaneously the order of them is not significant. 
Do NOT branch, skip, or create parallel paths.
Output only the sequence of relationships; no extra explanations.
Each concept MUST be atomic. Do not use "()" and "," symbols. 

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Format your output strictly as a JSON list of ordered relationships. Each element represents one step in the learning path.
Example output (Do not include any other annotations, start with [ symbol immediately):

[
{
node_1: Earlier concept in the learning path,
node_2: Next atomic concept derived from the context,
edge: Explanation of how node_2 builds on node_1 for a learner
},
{ }
